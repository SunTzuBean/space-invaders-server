How to run:

The project should be in Debug mode and in x86 configuration mode. To run, hit the "local window debugger" button.

How to play: Press A or left arrow to go left, press D or right arrow to go right, W or up arrow to jump.

The project was linked dynamically and statically. I don't know how but it was the only way to get it working. I have
all of the .dll files in the project directory but I specify that the linking is done statically in the settings. Not
sure why this is like this.
